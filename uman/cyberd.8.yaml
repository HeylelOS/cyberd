    description: >
        cyberd is an init process meant for UNIX-like operating systems.
        It is neither a System V-like nor a BSD-like init system. It only supports daemons,
        and starts them upon configuration-load/reload.
        Each daemon is associated with a file in the configuration directory (or directories).
        On HeylelOS this directory is \fB/data/daemons\fR.
        Only one instance of a daemon can run at any time, and through cyberctl(1), you may start stop or end it.

    features:
        cyberd was designed to be a daemon-leader as an init process.
        Its lack of other functionalities is only a proof of its UNIX-philosophy compliance.
