    description: >
        This command line interface is meant to execute commands to a cyberd instance.
        You can start, stop, reload or force-end a daemon.
        Depending on supported features, you can also poweroff, halt, reboot or suspend your system.
        Finally you can create a new socket to communicate witch cyberd, and remove supported commands
        for this new socket.
        This allows creations of less-priviliged sockets to restrict access only to needed features of cyberd.
    options:
        "-s socket": "Name of the socket to connect to."
        "-t when": "The when specifies the unix timestamp at which the command may be executed."
        "-c <name>": "Name of the new socket to create."
