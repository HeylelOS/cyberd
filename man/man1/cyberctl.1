.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This command line interface is meant to execute commands to a cyberd instance. You can start, stop, reload or force-end a daemon. Depending on supported features, you can also poweroff, halt, reboot or suspend your system. Finally you can create a new endpoint to communicate with cyberd, and remove supported commands for this new endpoint. This allows creations of less-priviliged endpoints to restrict access only to required features of cyberd.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
-s endpoint : Name of the endpoint to connect to.
.PP
-E : Executes the command relative to the epoch, not current time.
.PP
-t <when> : The when specifies the unix timestamp at which the command may be executed.
