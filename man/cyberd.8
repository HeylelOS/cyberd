.SH "DESCRIPTION"
cyberd is an init process meant for UNIX\-like operating systems. It is neither a System V\-like nor a BSD\-like init system. It only supports daemons, and starts them upon configuration\-load/reload. Each daemon is associated with a file in the configuration directory. On HeylelOS the default directory is \fB/data/daemons\fR. Only one instance of a daemon can run at any time, and through cyberctl(1), you may start stop or end it.

.SH "FEATURES"
cyberd was designed to be a daemon\-leader as an init process. Its lack of other functionalities is only a proof of its UNIX\-philosophy compliance.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
cyberd(5), cyberctl(1)
